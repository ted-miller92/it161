                <h3>Grant Readiness</h3>
                    <p>Is your organization ready to apply for a grant? If you find yourself answering “yes” to the following questions, then your organization is likely ready to seek out grant funding, and I can help you research, strategize for and obtain grants.</p>
                <div class="qualifications">

                    <h3>Proposal/Report Writing</h3>
                    <p>I am happy to work with your organization to write corporate, foundation or government grant proposals, as well as grant reports.</p>
                    <p>For corporate and foundation letters of inquiry or grant proposals, I will want to obtain existing information from you, such as annual reports, newsletters, or internal reports, in order to write an accurate and compelling proposal. For corporate or foundation grant reports, I will want to obtain the approved grant proposal and any other proposal documents or interim reports. My writing is persuasive, compelling, organized, logical and fact-based.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Prospect Research</h3>
                <p>I will find potential foundation, corporate, or government funding sources for your nonprofit. For each prospective funder, I will provide a research profile containing essential information, including: the prospective funder’s contact information, website, etc., funding priorities; geographic focus; common funding amounts and funding range; the application and grantmaking process; examples of relevant grants; current board of directors; and the prospect’s fit with your organization’s mission and programs.</p>

                    <h3>Grant Systems</h3>
                    <p>While getting grants is one thing, tracking them and organizing portfolios is another matter. I provide services that will help you develop and solidify your grants calendar, prospect tracking systems, funding readiness and donor strategy via the prospect pipeline.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Writing and Editing</h3>

                <p>Please note: I am unable to write grants for individuals, churches or institutions of faith, or for-profit businesses.</p>
