                <h2>Welcome</h2>
                <p>As a nonprofit professional, you are likely wearing many different hats, from program development to strategic planning to budgeting. You meet with community partners, volunteers and even governmental officials, and somehow, you have to find time to research, write and report on grant proposals.</p>
                <p>Thatâ€™s where I can come in. With years of experience in the nonprofit sector, I can help you and your mission-driven team better support your community. From a capital campaign fundraising for a renovated food bank to supporting a new community-based program for youth, I am ready to listen to you and your staff, learn your needs, and develop a compelling, evidence-driven story that stands out to funders.</p>
