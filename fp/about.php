                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Born in Seattle, raised in Poulsbo and educated in Walla Walla, I am a lifelong Washingtonian and dedicated to supporting nonprofits in the Pacific Northwest. Since graduating from Whitman College with a BA in Environmental Humanities, I have worked exclusively in the nonprofit sector in Puget Sound, supporting literary arts, social services and environmental organizations.</p>
                <p>I have experience writing grants for private foundations and county, state and federal levels of government.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, you can find me enjoying walks around Volunteer Park, trying new recipes,  cooking and baking, hiking and camping, and spending time relaxing with a movie, a book and families and friends.
                </p>
