                <p>The best way to learn something is to do it. The best way to learn a new language is to speak it. Well, I can't easily speak aloud HTML5 or CSS, but I can immerse myself in it.</p>
                <p>This website is my attempt at throwing myself into many of the commonly used methods and tools of the web. I've done some research pages, included some embedded elements and used previously established tools and libraries to make a fully functional website.</p>
                <p>Along the way I also learned about hosting my website locally, so I can more easily view php pages and elements.</p>
